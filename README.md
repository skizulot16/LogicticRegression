# Logistic Regression and Grid Search for Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for building a prediction model to predict whether someone could be diagnosed with diabetes or not using Logistic Regression and Grid Search. The model is built using the Kaggle Diabetes dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is the Kaggle Diabetes dataset. It contains various features related to health and lifestyle factors of individuals, along with a binary target variable indicating whether they have been diagnosed with diabetes or not.

The dataset can be found at the following link:
